# DataBaseDesign2023

This is a final project for COP 4710 - Database Design. 
Our group, including Huong Duong, Misha Nguyen, and Vu Le, decided to create an airline website called MSV Airlines. The purpose of our website is to allow users to view information about available flights and buy the ticket. We targeted to make our website user-friendly by using React. For the server side, we used Node.js and Express.js. We also used PostgreSQL to store all information in our database.
